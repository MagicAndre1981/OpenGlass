See [Compatibility and DWM architectures](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/wiki/Compatibility-and-DWM-architectures) for details.

## 3.1.0.3831 (unreleased)

Adds a preset library, separate user and machine configuration views, and simpler color controls.

## Quick start

1. Download `OpenGlassSetup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/releases).
2. Run the installer, which selects the matching DWM implementation, then open the GUI. It requests administrator rights.
3. Adjust the appearance. Settings are written immediately; **Save** accepts the changes, while **Revert** or closing the GUI undoes pending changes.

See the [configuration guide](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/wiki/Configuration-and-registry-reference) and [preset library guide](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/wiki/Preset-packages) for editing scopes, color options, presets and recovery behavior.

> [!TIP]
> **Emergency Exit:** Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to terminate DWM if the system becomes unresponsive.

OpenGlass is aimed at advanced users who are comfortable troubleshooting DWM. For a simpler alternative, consider [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass).

## Reporting issues

Report bugs in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/issues/new), with your exact Windows build, OpenGlass version and reproduction steps. For crashes or opaque glass, start with **Diagnostics** and the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-crash-dumps).

## Building

```powershell
msbuild OpenGlass.slnx /m /restore /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

See [Building OpenGlass](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/wiki/Building-OpenGlass) for prerequisites, tests and packaging, and the [Changelog](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass/wiki/Changelog) for technical version changes. CI artifacts are unsigned validation builds, not releases.

## Support

OpenGlass is developed in spare time and released under the GPLv3. DWM offers no official extension mechanism, so future Windows updates may break OpenGlass, and ongoing support cannot be guaranteed.

If you find OpenGlass valuable, please consider supporting it on Ko-fi. Donations are voluntary, come with no expectation of anything in return, and must be made as a natural person.
